# shinyMCE

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mul118/shinyMCE.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mul118/shinyMCE)

shinyMCE adds the ability to use tinyMCE WYSIWYG editor as a component
    in Shiny apps.

To install, run:

```r
if (!require("devtools"))
  install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("adanieljohnson/shinyMCE")
```

This is a clone of the original shinyMCE source code that comes from the [shinyMCE Github repo](https://github.com/mul118/shinyMCE). It is provided here as a convenience for users who need to install it as part of the SAWHET-2 lab report collection tool. 

More details and examples may be found at the [shinyMCE website](http://mul118.github.io/shinyMCE/).
